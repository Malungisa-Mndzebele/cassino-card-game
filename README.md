```bash
# Deploy locally for testing
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Or use npm scripts
npm run deploy
```

#### Server Deployment
Follow the comprehensive guide in `SERVER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to deploy to your own server.

**Benefits of Self-Hosting:**
- ✅ **Complete Infrastructure Control** - Full access to server configuration
- ✅ **No Third-Party Dependencies** - No reliance on external services
- ✅ **Custom Domain Configuration** - Direct control over DNS and routing
- ✅ **Full Access to Logs and Monitoring** - Complete visibility into performance
- ✅ **Cost-Effective Long-Term** - No ongoing subscription fees
- ✅ **Data Privacy** - Your data stays on your infrastructure
- ✅ **Custom Security Policies** - Implement your own security measures
- ✅ **Simplified Development** - Docker-based workflow with minimal dependencies

### Environment Variables

#### Frontend
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://backend:8000
REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://backend:8000
```

#### Backend
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://casino_user:casino_password@postgres:5432/casino_game
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3001,http://frontend:3000
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Database Configuration
The app uses PostgreSQL for both development and production. Database configuration is handled through Docker environment variables.

### CORS Configuration
Update `backend/main.py` to include your frontend domain:
```python
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://your-domain.com"]
```

### Development Server Configuration
The frontend uses an Express.js development server with proxy configuration in `dev-server.js`:
```javascript
// Proxy API requests to backend
app.use('/api', createProxyMiddleware({
  target: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://backend:8000',
  changeOrigin: true,
  pathRewrite: {
    '^/api': '', // remove /api prefix
  },
}));
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Timeout
- Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Verify Docker containers: `docker ps`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs backend`

#### Frontend Not Loading
- Check if frontend container is running: `docker ps`
- Verify Express.js server: `docker logs casino-frontend`
- Check proxy configuration in `dev-server.js`

#### Database Issues
