## Test Results

### Backend Tests
- **Total Tests:** 29
- **Passed:** 29 ‚úÖ
- **Failed:** 0
- **Success Rate:** 100%

### Test Categories

- Deck creation and card values
- Card dealing (initial and round 2)
- Capture validation (direct match, sum match, invalid)
- Build validation (valid and invalid scenarios)
- Value combination logic
- Capture, build, and trail execution
- Score calculation and bonus scoring
- Winner determination
- Round and game completion detection
- Possible captures and builds

#### API Endpoint Tests (9 tests) ‚úÖ

- Health check endpoint
- Room creation
- Room joining
- Game state retrieval
- Player ready status
- Shuffle start
- Face-up card selection
- Card playing (trail action)
- Game reset

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Unicode Encoding Errors ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Test runners used emoji characters that caused `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows terminal.

**Files Fixed:**
- `backend/run_simple_tests.py`
- `backend/run_all_tests.py`

**Solution:** Replaced all emoji characters with ASCII text:
- üß™ ‚Üí "Running"
- ‚úÖ ‚Üí "PASSED" / "[PASS]"
- ‚ùå ‚Üí "FAILED" / "[FAIL]"
- üìä ‚Üí "Test Summary"
- etc.

### 2. Database Connection Errors ‚úÖ
**Problem:** API tests were trying to connect to PostgreSQL which wasn't running locally.

**File Fixed:** `backend/test_main_simple.py`

**Solution:** 
- Created in-memory SQLite database for testing
- Added `StaticPool` configuration for thread safety
- Overrode the `get_db` dependency to use test database
- Added `setup_method` to create tables before each test
- Added `teardown_method` to clean up after each test

### 3. Field Name Mismatch ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Test expected `round_number` but API returned `round`.

**File Fixed:** `backend/test_main_simple.py`

**Solution:** Updated test assertion to use correct field name `round` instead of `round_number`.

## How to Run Tests

### All Tests
```bash
cd backend
python run_all_tests.py
```

### Game Logic Tests Only
```bash
cd backend
python run_simple_tests.py
```

### Via npm (from project root)
```bash
npm test
```

## Test Configuration

### Backend Testing Stack
- **Framework:** Custom test runner (no pytest dependency)
- **Database:** SQLite in-memory for tests
- **HTTP Client:** FastAPI TestClient
- **Coverage:** 100% of game logic and API endpoints

### Test Database Setup
```python
# In-memory SQLite with StaticPool
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///:memory:"
engine = create_engine(
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},
    poolclass=StaticPool,
)
```

## Continuous Integration
All tests are ready for CI/CD pipelines:
- Exit code 0 on success
- Exit code 1 on failure
- Clean test output
- No external dependencies (PostgreSQL) required for testing

## Next Steps
- Frontend integration tests can be added using Vitest (framework already configured)
- Consider adding test coverage reporting
- Add E2E tests for complete game flow
