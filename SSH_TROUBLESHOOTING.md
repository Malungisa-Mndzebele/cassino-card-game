# 🔧 SSH Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Your Server Details:
- **Host**: khasinogaming.com (IP: 66.29.148.81)
- **Username**: cassino@khasinogaming.com
- **Path**: /home/mawdqtvped/khasinogaming.com/cassino
- **Password**: @QWERTYasd

## 🚨 Current Issue:
SSH connection is timing out, which means:
1. Either the SSH service is not running
2. Or we're using the wrong port
3. Or there's a firewall blocking port 22

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps:

### 1. Check if your hosting provider uses cPanel
```bash
# Try accessing cPanel
https://khasinogaming.com:2083
```

### 2. Try different SSH ports
```bash
# Common alternate ports
ssh -p 2222 cassino@khasinogaming.com
ssh -p 22022 cassino@khasinogaming.com
```

### 3. Try direct IP connection
```bash
ssh cassino@66.29.148.81
```

### 4. Check if SFTP is available
```bash
# Using FileZilla or WinSCP:
Host: khasinogaming.com
Username: cassino@khasinogaming.com
Password: @QWERTYasd
Port: 22 (or try 2222)
```

### 5. Check hosting control panel
1. Log in to your hosting control panel
2. Look for "SSH Access" or "Shell Access"
3. Make sure SSH access is enabled
4. Check if there's a specific port mentioned

### 6. Contact hosting support
Ask them:
1. Is SSH access enabled for your account?
2. What port should you use for SSH?
3. What's the correct username format?
4. Are there any special SSH requirements?

## 🔐 Alternative Deployment Methods:

### 1. FTP Deployment
```bash
# Using FileZilla:
Host: khasinogaming.com
Username: cassino@khasinogaming.com
Password: @QWERTYasd
Port: 21
```

### 2. cPanel Git Deployment
1. Log into cPanel
2. Look for "Git Version Control"
3. Set up repository
4. Use automatic deployment

### 3. Web-based File Manager
1. Log into cPanel
2. Use File Manager
3. Upload files directly
