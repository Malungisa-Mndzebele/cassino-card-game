# üîß SSH Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Your Server Details:
- **Host**: khasinogaming.com (IP: 66.29.148.81)
- **Username**: [YOUR_FTP_USERNAME]
- **Path**: [YOUR_SERVER_PATH]/cassino
- **Password**: [YOUR_FTP_PASSWORD]

## üö® Current Issue:
SSH connection is timing out, which means:
1. Either the SSH service is not running
2. Or we're using the wrong port
3. Or there's a firewall blocking port 22

## üîç Troubleshooting Steps:

### 1. Check if your hosting provider uses cPanel
```bash
# Try accessing cPanel
https://khasinogaming.com:2083
```

### 2. Try different SSH ports
```bash
# Common alternate ports
ssh -p 2222 [YOUR_FTP_USERNAME]@[YOUR_FTP_HOST]
ssh -p 22022 [YOUR_FTP_USERNAME]@[YOUR_FTP_HOST]
```

### 3. Try direct IP connection
```bash
ssh cassino@66.29.148.81
```

### 4. Check if SFTP is available
```bash
# Using FileZilla or WinSCP:
Host: khasinogaming.com
Username: [YOUR_FTP_USERNAME]
Password: [YOUR_FTP_PASSWORD]
Port: 22 (or try 2222)
```

### 5. Check hosting control panel
1. Log in to your hosting control panel
2. Look for "SSH Access" or "Shell Access"
3. Make sure SSH access is enabled
4. Check if there's a specific port mentioned

### 6. Contact hosting support
Ask them:
1. Is SSH access enabled for your account?
2. What port should you use for SSH?
3. What's the correct username format?
4. Are there any special SSH requirements?

## üîê Alternative Deployment Methods:

### 1. FTP Deployment
```bash
# Using FileZilla:
Host: khasinogaming.com
Username: [YOUR_FTP_USERNAME]
Password: [YOUR_FTP_PASSWORD]
Port: 21
```

### 2. cPanel Git Deployment
1. Log into cPanel
2. Look for "Git Version Control"
3. Set up repository
4. Use automatic deployment

### 3. Web-based File Manager
1. Log into cPanel
2. Use File Manager
3. Upload files directly
