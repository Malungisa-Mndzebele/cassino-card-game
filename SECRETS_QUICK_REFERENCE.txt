GitHub Secrets Quick Reference
=============================

Go to: https://github.com/Malungisa-Mndzebele/cassino-card-game/settings/secrets/actions

Add these 4 secrets:

1. HOST = khasinogaming.com
2. USERNAME = cassino  
3. SSH_KEY = [Your private SSH key content]
4. PORT = 22

To get your SSH key:
- If you have one: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
- If you need to create one: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[YOUR_EMAIL]"

Then copy the public key to your server:
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [YOUR_FTP_USERNAME]@[YOUR_FTP_HOST]

Test connection:
ssh [YOUR_FTP_USERNAME]@[YOUR_FTP_HOST]

Once configured, push to master and your game will auto-deploy!
